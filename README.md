# Backend Data Ingestion API (FastAPI)

This repository demonstrates a backend service built using Python and FastAPI
to showcase database connectivity and data ingestion patterns commonly used
in production backend systems.

The focus of this project is on clean backend structure, API design, and
data handling workflows rather than full production logic.

## Overview

The service is designed to:
- Manage database connections
- Expose APIs for basic schema and table discovery
- Demonstrate data ingestion workflows
- Follow clean backend architecture principles

This repository serves as a representative example of my backend development work.

> Note: Most of my professional experience involves client projects under NDA,
so production code cannot be shared publicly. This repository is a simplified
example created to demonstrate my backend design and implementation approach.

## Tech Stack

- Python
- FastAPI

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- FastAPI application structure
- Database connection handling
- Separation of concerns
- API validation and documentation
- Scalable backend patterns
- NDA-safe backend representation
- POC-oriented API design

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository  
2. Create and activate a virtual environment  
3. Install dependencies  
4. Configure environment variables  
5. Run the FastAPI server  

## Use Cases
